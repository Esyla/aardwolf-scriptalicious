*When I get a demon school student as area campaign target, I get two every time, one listed in soh and one in sohtwo. Killing just one (in soh) gives credit for both.*

_This is because the area is listed as "School of Horror" which is the name of 2 areas! It could be the area "soh" or "soh2". So I list both areas for the one mobbecause there is no way to tell which one it means._
