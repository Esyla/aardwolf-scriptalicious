#Help on getting the most out of Fiendish's mapper plugin

= Disclaimer! =

Hi, I didn't write it, but i use it and leverage it in my plugin.  Fiendish's mapper plugin.  To use my triple pack you're going to want to know these fundamentals first!

= To Create a Cexit (aka Custom Exit) =
{{{
   mapper cexit open n;;n
}}}
This will tell to mapper to open a door and walk through it.

== DETAILED STEPS ==
  * find a closed door north 
  * mapper cexit open n;;n 
  * 2 seconds, you will see a blue mapping confirm message.. 
  * south back to the first room 
  * the door north 
  * the clickable map.. click on the room north of you 
  * will see the mapper open the door and walk you through it
